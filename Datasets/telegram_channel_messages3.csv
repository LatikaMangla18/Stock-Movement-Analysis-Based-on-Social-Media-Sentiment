🎉 Moody's affirms Baa3 long-term ratings for Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank & PNB Bank🎉

Affirmed Ratings:
🏦Bank of Baroda
🏦Canara Bank
🏦Punjab National Bank

Upgraded BCAs: All 3 banks' Baseline Credit Assessments have been #upgraded from ba3 to ba2🚀

What does this mean?
📈Strengthened Financial Stability: Reflects improved financial health & resilience of these major banks.

💪Enhanced Creditworthiness: A step up in the global credit scale, showcasing the banks' robust operational strength.

📈 Key Highlights:
1️⃣Improved Credit Metrics: The ratings reflect stronger credit fundamentals, supported by India's robust operating environment over the next 12-18 months.

2️⃣Declining non-performing loan (NPL) Ratios:
🔸BOB: NPL down to 2.9% (from 3.8%)
🔸Canara: 4.2% (from 5.4%)
🔸PNB: 5.7% (from 8.7%)

3️⃣Enhanced Profitability: Better asset quality leads to lower credit costs, boosting profitability. However, rising funding costs may moderate profitability in the near term.

4️⃣Stable Capitalization:
🔸BOB: CET1 ratio at 12.5%
🔸Canara: CET1 ratio at 11.6%
🔸PNB: CET1 ratio at 11.0%

5️⃣Strong Liquidity Buffers: Low reliance on market funds & strong deposit franchises, thanks to their public sector status & government linkages.

🌟 What's Next?
➡️Upgrades Possible: If tangible common equity (TCE) as a percentage of risk-weighted assets (RWA) improves and net income increases.
➡️Risks of Downgrade: Potential if India's sovereign rating is downgraded or if the banks' asset quality deteriorates significantly."

13710,-1001372819690,2023-07-30 14:34:41+00:00,"Mukesh Ambani is disrupting Rs 44.4 Lakh Cr mutual fund sector in Jio way!

He made Jio Blackrock, a JV (50:50) with world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock with an initial capital of Rs 2380 Cr.

They are set to begin with low-cost passive products.

JFS (Jio Financial Services) has received Rs 20700 Cr liquid assets from Reliance Services.

Here’s his roadmap:

- Enter B2B credit business.
- Get in consumer lending.
- Break into insurance, payments, digital broking and asset management.

Though JFS has to face tough tests from 40+ competitors and regulations.

Such as,

- SBI, ICICI, HDFC, Nippon, Kotak Mahindra, ABSL and Axis are top players holding 80% share of this industry.

- Bajaj Finserv has entered it recently.

- Paytm, PhonePe, Simpl and CRED are there in lending.

- Zerodha is also set to launch mutual funds as it'll get a final signal from SEBI soon.

It’ll build a platform with smallcase.

As Rs 5.4 Lakh Cr is invested in ETFs which is 12% of total assets under AUM (Asset Under Management), Ambani has seen AUM of India's MF industry 2X in last 5 years.🇮🇳

Here are 5 strategies Mota Bhai is using to apply his JIO playbook:

1. Noble Mission:

Due to issues in distribution, millions of retail investors can’t buy passive funds.

He's set to remove them and make it seamless.

His target is to democratise investing in India through “Fit for India” movement.

2. Partnership:

Blackrock’s digital platform Aladdin (Asset, Liability, Debt and Derivative Investment Network) fits his plan for India.

Aladdin is used by 200+ global firms.

It’ll leverage tech and data to bring affordable and innovative solutions.

3. Advantage:

It’s set to leverage its footprint at 18500+ stores of Reliance Retail and 448.5 million subscriber base of Jio.

4. Untapped market:

As India is set to be world's 3rd largest economy in 4 - 7 years, working portion of 1.4 billion population will invest more.

Such as people from Tier-2, Tier-3 cities and beyond are still untapped.

5. Track record:

After demerger, JFS has already 3rd largest NBFC in India with Rs 1.66 Lakh Cr valuation.

In telecom, he’s erased all competitors in only 7 years which he’s copying here.

On other hand, Blackrock left India in 2018 when its 60:40 JV with DSP group fell apart. It’ll revise its last mistakes.

As ratio of mutual fund AUM to India’s GDP is only 16% compared to world's average of 63%, it’s a huge scope of growth.🚀"

• Prestige & Above segment net sales grew 23.2% with strong double-digit growth buoyed by continued momentum in our innovation & renovation offerings. 

• Rebased net sales for the popular segment shrunk 6.3% as inflation continues to impact this price-sensitive consumer segment.

• A&P re-investment rate during the quarter was 13.8% of sales largely reflecting the high spend on the BIO portfolio that normalised on market supplies after three quarters.

Advanced Materials continued its growth trajectory and delivered a 22% higher top-line compared to last year, and also delivered an improved margin.  

Arvind Limited closed the financial year at a net debt of ₹1327 crores which was ₹356 crores lower than March 2022 levels. Long term debt reduced by ₹304 crores over this period.  

While the business environment is still cautious, Arvind remains optimistic about its key businesses and has laid out an investment plan of about Rs 600 crores to augment capacities and deepen its sustainability credentials."

From the current levels, this translates into an upside of nearly 29 per cent.

For this, while the corporate earnings are projected to compound 25 per cent annually over FY22-25, Morgan Stanley expects India to be included in the global bond indices, which could result in nearly $20 billion of inflows over the subsequent 12 months. That apart, commodity prices including oil and fertiliser are expected to correct sharply.

1. During April-October 2022, APSEZ clocked around 203 MMT of cargo volumes, which is a good 10% YoY growth. This volume jump is despite the extended monsoon, which adversely impacted the coal demand, higher duties on steel exports, and export ban on certain qualities of rice. 
 
2. In October, APSEZ handled ~25 MMT cargo. The daily average run-rate of ~1 MMT in the second half of October reflects a pick-up in volumes versus the rate of September and the first half of October.  

3. In the initial 7 months of FY23, east coast volumes are up 11% YoY, supported by Krishnapatnam (+14%),Gangavaram (+4%) and Kattupalli & Ennore combined (+49%). The west coast volume jump of 9% is supported by Mundra (6%), Dahej (64%), Tuna (10%), and Goa (17%), and Hazira (3%)."

Why Federal Bank acquisition by Kotak is unlikely

1) For any potential acquirer, there needs to be a promoter with more than 20 percent stake willing to sell.... Looking at FED BANK shareholding , there are no promoters and no one holds more than 10%

It means that two or three entities need to act in consort to sell to an Acquirer for a minimum 20 percent assured stake... 

2) For existing banking players acquisition of branches are no longer any large value add,as RBI has made branch opening simpler.

3) Kotak has always been on the prowl for an acquisition, but at its own price.... Nothing has changed in the last six months to catalyze the acquisition...

The report added: “We take comfort in the board’s assertion that the company has an effective mechanism for succession planning for the orderly succession of directors and senior management personnel. We raise concerns that he (Sharma) is not liable to retire by rotation, and that he will get board permanency if he continues in a non-executive capacity following the end of his term as managing director.”"

This is even as the fuel subsidies have been reined in and are set to be nearly eliminated in the current fiscal itself.

It would be the third year in a row in 2022-23 that the annual budget spending on fertiliser subsidy hovers around Rs 1.3 lakh crore from a lower range of about Rs 70,000-80,000 crore for a few years in the past. The subsidy bill rose 57% on year to Rs 1.27 lakh crore in FY21 as the government cleared arrears of about Rs 65,000 crore as part of the Covid-related packages. The surge in the international prices of fertilisers, as well as key ingredients, is estimated to inflate the subsidy on fertilisers to Rs 1.38 lakh crore in FY22, up 73% from the budget estimate (BE) of Rs 79,530 crore."

Shares climbed in Japan, Australia and South Korea. U.S. futures pushed higher after the S&P 500 wiped out its November losses and the technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 more than recouped Friday’s rout.

The Singapore-traded SGX Nifty, an early indicator of India's Nifty 50 Index's performance, rose 0.24% at 17,131 as of 7:00 a.m.

The picture was different in Treasuries, which dipped but retained much of the haven rally induced by the virus. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said omicron poses risks to both sides of the central bank’s mandate for stable prices and maximum employment.

The yen weakened and a dollar gauge was steady. Crude oil advanced. Separately, traders are awaiting purchasing-manager indexes from China to assess the outlook for the world’s second-largest economy."

1121,-1001372819690,2021-10-15 16:03:55+00:00,"🔸Business in the Week Ahead (October 18-22, 2021)🔸
The corporate earnings season has begun. The economy is reviving. But supply chain issues remain a sticking point. How is the world coping with the emerging challenges? Next week, keep track of RBI policy minutes, PMIs and a host of macro releases   
🎈The Indian economy in its current shape presents a picture of rapid recovery. Take parameters like inflation and factory growth. They are a clear vindication of the RBI keeping its accommodative stance. Even other key high frequency data points such as tax collections, foreign trade, energy use and so on, all paint an inspiring picture. Consumer sentiment too is taking a turn for the better.

Some of the early bird corporate earnings are a pretty good sight to relish. IT sector results so far have already set up the pitch for more likely fireworks. As they say, well begun is half done.

All these, along with a low interest rate environment, are proving to be a heady cocktail for Mr Market, which is out a make a point with a vengeance. So much so that from last Dussehra to this, it has run up close to 50 percent. With both the Sensex and the Nifty ruling at their all-time peaks, the view from the top is only getting more and more fascinating.

Add to this the government’s resolve to fast-track infrastructure projects through the launch of the mega Gati Shakti master plan in an attempt to accelerate the recovery work.

All this is fine, but there lurk a few known unknowns. The simmering coal shortage and the resultant energy crisis is one. Semiconductor chips, crude oil and natural gas are also posing a tough challenge for policymakers on the logistics and supply chain front. Don’t discount inflation worries on the back of boiling crude oil prices and the potential impact of US bond yields firming up on the Fed plans to ease its bond buying programme.
🎈Sure, these can upset the growth applecart. But at the end of the day, it’s the resilience of the economy to fight the odds that can save the day for the investor. As the festive season turns louder by the day, do not lower your guard and stay on the right side of caution.

How is the week ahead placed? What are the factors in play? Which cue to take? Here’s a look.

October 18 (Monday)

Results: By far, better than expected corporate results have given investors much to look forward to. On Monday, L&T Infotech, UltraTech Cement, Tata Coffee, Craftsman Automation and Hatsun Agro Product, among others, are poised to announce their financial numbers.

China GDP Growth Rate: Is the Chinese economy showing signs of fatigue? It grew at 7.9 percent year-on-year in Q2 of 2021, a sharp fall from a record 18.3 percent growth in Q1. Where does it go from there? The Q3 data, due on Monday, can throw some light. Lower factory activity, pricey raw material, and new COVID cases in some regions all can take a toll.

October 19 (Tuesday)

Results: Among those which are pencilled in for Tuesday, investors are keenly watching the scorecards of Hindustan Unilever, Nestle India, ACC, L&T Technology Services, Network18 Media & Investments, ICICI Securities, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, 5paisa Capital and Mastek. How will they fare?

US Housing Starts: Housing starts in the US, a barometer for economic activity, climbed 3.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.61 million units in August. That’s a rebound from a 6.2 percent fall in July and also ahead of market forecasts of 1.55 million. Did September sustain that upside?

October 20 (Wednesday)

Results: As the September quarter results season picks up tempo, keep your eyes firmly on Havells India, Jubilant FoodWorks, Angel Broking, JustDial, Shoppers Stop, Tata Communications and L&T Finance Holdings, which are getting ready to lay out their financial report cards."

More than 300 stocks, including Tata Motors, SBI, Lloyds Steels Industries and Jubilant FoodWorks, hit a 52-week high on the BSE

The market closed higher for the fourth consecutive session after yet another day of volatile trade on October 12, supported by PSU bank, metal, FMCG and auto names.

At close, the Sensex was up 148.53 points, or 0.25 percent, at 60,284.31 and the Nifty was up 46 points or 0.26 percent at 17,992.

""Following selling in IT stocks as a result of a weak start to the earnings season and weakness in global markets, the domestic market traded in the negative zone,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

But, strong support from PSU banks on renewed hopes of privatisation and continued buying in consumer goods, metals and auto helped indices close on a positive note, he said.

Global markets traded lower on fears of rising inflation due to soaring commodity prices and energy crunch, Nair added.

Titan Company, Bajaj Auto, Bajaj Finserv, SBI and Hindalco were among the major gainers on the Nifty. HCL Technologies, HDFC Life, Coal India, Tech Mahindra and Shree Cement were among the big losers.

The Nifty IT index shed nearly a percent, however, auto, FMCG, PSU bank and metal indices were up 1-3 percent.

The broader indices BSE midcap and smallcap indices rose 0.2-0.6 percent.

Stocks and sectors

On the BSE, except IT, all sectoral indices ended in the green. FMCG, metal and auto were up a percent each.

Among individual stocks, a volume spike of more than 200 percent was seen in Jubilant FoodWorks, Canara Bank and Bajaj Auto.

Long buildup was seen in Bata India, Crompton Greaves Consumer Electrical and Astral, while short buildup was seen in TCS, Dalmia Bharat and Bandhan Bank.

More than 300 stocks, including Tata Motors, SBI, Lloyds Steels Industries, Jubilant FoodWorks and Delta Corp, hit a 52-week high on the BSE.

Technical view

The Nifty formed a bullish candle on the daily frame, with a long lower shadow indicating buying visible on every small decline.

""Now, it has to hold above 17,950 for an up move towards 18,100 and 18,200 levels, whereas on the downside, support is seen at 17,850 and 17,777 zones,"" said Chandan Taparia, Vice President, Analyst-Derivatives, Motilal Oswal Financial Services."

As per our channel checks, DASDA prices have increased steeply to Rs 450/kg. The price was around Rs 300/kg about 8-10 days back. 

This is due to increase in Para Nitro Toluene Prices and Caustic soda prices.

DASDA prices are expected to further go up. Demand remains healthy from Dyes, Paints and textile industry.

Higher DASDA prices and Phenol-Acetone spreads bode well for Deepak Nitrite

➡️Our channel check shows in Q2FY22 DASDA prices have increased significantly both QoQ and YoY and we expect the trend to continue into Q3FY22.
➡️The increase in price could potentially be driven by strong demand for the end use products in dyes, textiles, paints, paper etc. The Performance Products (DASDA and OBA) segment constituted only 7% of group sales in FY21 vs 18% in FY20, largely due to low DASDA prices on the back of COVID-19 related demand softness. The current pricing environment could result in potential turnaround of the segment.
➡️In addition Phenol-Acetone spread is up in last one month. We enter Q3FY22 with a strong spread.
➡️Management in recent media interaction highlighted (i) None of the finished products have key raw material dependence on China (ii) Company is seeing strong prices and have recently increased product prices (iii) Seeing structural shift in inventory management by customers.
➡️ Our view : The increase in DASDA prices and strong phenolic spreads as we enter Q3FY22, reaffirms our positive view on Deepak Nitrite. The stock is currently trading at 29x FY23 PE and we expect potential upside if current chemical prices hold.

Now onwards, its matter of time, we will see again market size slowing will keep increasing with increase in ARPU - its win –win for all.  

In last five years, price of each commodity, article and services have gone up except your monthly charge of mobile exps.

Bet BIG on telecom, now it’s not who’s gain and who’s loss, if ARPU goes up significantly, all three players (Reliance, Bharti, Idea) will make money (like we seen in steel, cement, chemical etc), there return ratios will look good."
